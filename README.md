# Deep-Brain-Stimulation
This repository contained codes in Python that I have written for a project on deep brain stimualtion with electrode. 

- The aim of the project is the compute the minimum distance between the electrodes body parts and ventricles/sulci. This project was carried out on medical data and with 3D slicer
